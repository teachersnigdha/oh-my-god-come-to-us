```
Please forgive me, my Lord Shiv
I beg you for ever,
Violence, magic and desire, tie me up,
Me crying in the world.

No mercy, I have so much,
Living in this mortal world,
Your presence, i don't feel,
Around the world, disease and mourning has increased.

So many tragic events,
Come one by one,
But you are, in the peak of Kailash,
Whom will we appeal then?

Sweeping us, is grave fear,
Give us a vision, make us fearless,
Seeing earth conditions, from above,
You see us always, from Kailash peak.

I don't have the language to describe it,
Will the Lord come and run, if we singÂ ???
In this living world, the bridge of patience,
Shaking and falling since much time.

Knower of everything, oh my God,
Your eyes are all around,
How will your world move on?
Oh my God, come to us.
