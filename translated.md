```
Forgiveness, now Srihar,
I beg you for ever,
Violence Maya Moh, tied up,
Roaring in the world.

No mercy, I have so much,
There is life in this mortal world,
Yours sincerely,
Disease mourning has increased around the world.

As tragic as it is,
One by one,
You are Sina, Kailash learns,
We will appeal to anyone.

Fear of cockroaches,
Give me a vision, fear,
Earth conditions, above Thai,
You see, the policy is Kailash Sai.

I don't have the language to describe it,
Will the Lord come and runÂ ???
In this living world, the bridge of destiny,
When did you get lost?

Everyone is gone, O Trilochan,
Your eyes all around,
How to walk, your world,
The incarnation of God is my God.
```
